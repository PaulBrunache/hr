Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Our team members have attempted to contact your referral on two occasions to
follow up on your submission to our employee referral program.  Unfortunately,
we have not been able to connect with <%= @referral.first_name.capitalize %> on either one of our
attempts. Please reach out and notify <%= @referral.first_name.capitalize %>  that we are interested
in connecting with them. The referral team will try to contact them one more time;
if they do not respond in-kind your referral will be closed.

MorseLife Health System appreciates the time you spent in consideration when referring
<%= @referral.first_name.capitalize %>. We encourage you to visit our careers page at www.morselifecareers.org
and continue to refer individuals that will impact the organization.

Thank you for all that you do,

Employee Referral Team | MorseLife Health System
